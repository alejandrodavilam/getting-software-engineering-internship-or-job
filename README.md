## Overview
In this guide I will share a few things I wish I knew when I was a freshman in college. I will talk to you about opportunities that are available every year that go unnoticed by unaware or underprepared students. 
I will set you up with a plan to prepare yourself for these opportunities and help you get that first software engineering internship.

## Internship Opportunities
Many top tech companies recruit passionate students so that, in the future, these students can return to the company for more challenging internships or for full-time positions. 
Internships are a great way to test potential employees and see whether they deserve a spot in the company when they graduate from school. They are also a great way for students to try out a job and a company to see if the role is something they’d like to pursue and if the company is a place they’d like to work.
These internships focus on passion for programming and uniqueness. Some of them request short essays to answer personal questions.
The following list contains a few of the summer internships. I am sure there are more opportunities available, but I will focus on these ones:

### Amazon
Amazon Future Engineer
Description: 
The Amazon Future Engineer (AFE) internship program offers hands-on software development experience to college freshmen and sophomores who are making an early commitment to computer science. 

Our AFE interns will partner with experienced software development engineers, who both help and challenge them as they work on projects that matter to our customers. They will be immersed in the exciting and innovative culture and make lasting connections with other AFE interns and Amazon pioneers.

Deadline: 
December 31st

### Dropbox
Dropbox Launch
Description: 
The Dropbox Launch Program is a technical internship geared towards students who are looking for their first internship and a kick-start to their professional career - no prior experience required!  Dropbox Launch is open to students of all backgrounds, and we particularly encourage applicants from historically underrepresented groups in technology.    

Dropbox Launch aims to provide participants with a 12 week immersive experience at our San Francisco Headquarters. Our goal is to provide participants with an incredible and practical learning opportunity and help students apply university teachings to industry engineering. And if that wasn’t enough, Dropbox Launch interns receive a learning budget to further their accomplishments over the summer. 

Deadline: 
February

### Facebook
Facebook U

Throughout the duration of the program you’ll be paired with an engineering mentor who will help guide you along the way.

Deadline: 
January 15th

### Google
Google Engineering Practicum
Description: 
The Engineering Practicum (EP) program is a 12-week developmental opportunity for first and second-year undergraduate students with a passion for technology — especially students from historically underrepresented groups including women, Native American, Black, Latino, Veteran and students with disabilities. 

Our unique internship offers the opportunity to work on a software project alongside other EP interns and full-time Googlers, and gives you the chance to bridge the gap between academic understanding and practical professional experience.

Deadline:

### More Internships
Most companies offer internships for Juniors or Seniors, so it is hard to post all of them here. 
What I can do is give you a list of companies so that you can go to their website and look for opportunities.

Click here to do Company Research.      Here you will find a list of companies and a guideline on how to look for available positions.
If you are looking to work at a startup, go to AngelList.
If you are looking for a public company, go to Fortune 500 companies.
If you are looking for a private company, go to Unicorn’s List.
If you are looking for software companies, take a look at this list.

## Programming
If you are completely new to programming it is important to have a study plan. All programming languages are different somehow, so you must become proficient in at least one of them so that it becomes easier to learn the rest.  These are some of the areas you can focus on:
### Web Development
HTML and CSS: if you want to build website you will have to learn these two. HTML is the skeleton of the website, and CSS is the styling of it. Click here to learn HTML.
JavaScript: the programming language of the web browser, it turns static websites into dynamic and cool websites. Click here to learn JavaScript.
Web Frameworks: these frameworks are used to have more robust and structured web applications: React (JavaScript), Angular (JavaScript), Ruby on Rails, Django (Python),   jQuery (JavaScript)
### Software Development
Java: widely used object-oriented programming language. Mostly used to develop Server Applications, Web Applications, Mobile Applications (Android), Desktop Applications, Enterprise Applications, and Games
Python: powerful scripting language. It is maybe one of the easiest to learn because of its simple syntax. Mostly used for Web Development, Data Science (machine learning, data analysis, data visualization), and Scripting (automate tasks).
C#: object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is used in most of Microsoft’s products. Mostly used to develop Server Applications, Web Applications, Mobile Applications (Android and iOS), Desktop Applications, Enterprise
### Applications and Games
C++: object-oriented programming language. It is good for performance and efficiency. Mostly used for Web Applications, Desktop Applications, Enterprise Applications, and Games
C: low-level programming language. Can connect hardware and software. Mostly used for Operating Systems, Compilers, Assemblers, Network Drivers, Data Bases, Utilities, and more.

This guide will focus on Java and Python for now.
